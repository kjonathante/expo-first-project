We have to start somewhere so let’s start with the ImagePicker. There’s a runnable example of it on the documentation page so let’s just copy that to get something running. Before pasting it into our app we will install all of the examples’ dependencies using expo install. expo install is a wrapper around npm and yarn to ensure that the version of the Expo SDK and React Native community packages that you install are compatible with your app. When we paste the code in, the app will reload and we now have a working image picker.

```javascript
import * as React from "react";
import { Button, Image, View } from "react-native";
import * as ImagePicker from "expo-image-picker";
import Constants from "expo-constants";
import * as Permissions from "expo-permissions";

export default class ImagePickerExample extends React.Component {
  state = {
    image: null
  };

  render() {
    let { image } = this.state;

    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
        <Button
          title="Pick an image from camera roll"
          onPress={this._pickImage}
        />
        {image && (
          <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
        )}
      </View>
    );
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.getPermissionAsync();
    console.log("hi");
  }

  getPermissionAsync = async () => {
    if (Constants.platform.ios) {
      const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA_ROLL);
      if (status !== "granted") {
        alert("Sorry, we need camera roll permissions to make this work!");
      }
    }
  };

  _pickImage = async () => {
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.All,
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1
    });

    console.log(result);

    if (!result.cancelled) {
      this.setState({ image: result.uri });
    }
  };
}

```

```bash
expo install expo-permissions expo-image-picker expo-constants
```
